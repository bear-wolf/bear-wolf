		Trouble Looms in Dr. Wells’ Office

                        “I’ll bet this is why four billing clerks quit!” exclaimed Cheryl, <br />
                        waving the prior authorization form in front of Dr. Wells. “Do you  <br />
                        realize what has to be done every time you prescribe a medication <br />
                        the patient’s insurance company doesn’t cover? Just look at the <br />
                        first page of this insane document. And, every insurance company <br />
                        has a different form. Our staff wants to feel like they are part of a <br />
                        team, not like a bunch of data-entry drones!”</p>

                    <p>Dr. Wells was taken aback by his head nurse’s intensity. “Cheryl, <br />
                        I’m not sure I agree with you. I trust your judgment, but four <br />
                        employees resigning in two weeks because of an insurance form?</p>

                    <p class="Top">I find that hard to believe.”</p>
                    <p>Cheryl continued her tirade, “Even though none of them <br />
                        gave a specific reason for quitting, my money is on the prior <br />
                        authorization process. They were fed up. It’s that simple!” </p>
                    <p>“There has to be more to it than that,” said Dr. Wells. “The <br />
                        physician assistants, nurses, and even receptionists seem to <br />
                        be down in the dumps. Could this one task really be creating <br />
                        a domino effect that’s causing things to spiral out of control <br />
                        in our office?”</p>
