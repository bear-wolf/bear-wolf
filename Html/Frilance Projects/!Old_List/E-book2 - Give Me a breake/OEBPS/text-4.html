                    <p>As Wendy Berman strode through the door and extended  <br />
                        her hand, Dr. Wells knew immediately there would be no <br />
                        uncomfortable power dynamic in this relationship. Wendy <br />
                        had a commanding presence, a firm handshake, and a <br />
                        friendly smile that soon put him at ease.</p>                    
                    <p>“Thank you for coming in, Wendy,” Dr. Wells said, as he <br />
                        gestured for her to take a seat in the armchair in front <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:88pt;"></span>of his desk. Wendy wasted no time.</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:145px">“It’s my pleasure, Dr. Wells. I’m <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:7pt;"></span>here to get a general sense of <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:12pt;"></span>the situation, and I’m all about <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:12pt;"></span>efficiency. So, tell me, in under <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:12pt;"></span>30 seconds, what’s going on, <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:35pt;"></span>leaving out any extraneous <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:40pt;"></span>information, even if you <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:45pt;"></span>have a strong desire to <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:50pt;"></span>give me details.”</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:170px">
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:20pt;"></span>“It’s pretty simple,” said <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:20pt;"></span>Dr. Wells. “Four of my billing <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:25pt;"></span>employees recently resigned <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:30pt;"></span>without telling me why, and everyone <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:30pt;"></span>in the office seems to have lost their <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:25pt;"></span>enthusiasm and willingness to help. <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:0pt;"></span>My head nurse, Cheryl, thinks it has to <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:5pt;"></span>do with the prior authorization form.”</p>
                </td>
                <td class="Last">                
                    <p>“Okay, stop right there, Dr. Wells,” Wendy interjected. “Sorry <br />
                        to interrupt, but remember, I need to hear only the objective <br />
                        facts, not what you or anyone else believes or thinks.”</p>                    
                    <p>“We are trying to be objective. We have already conducted two <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:45pt;"></span> focus groups, handed out a job satisfaction questionnaire <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:72pt;"></span>to our staff, and even hired my friend’s son, who’s <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:90pt;"></span>home from college for the summer, to do <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:100pt;"></span>some research on job satisfaction in small <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:106pt;"></span>organizations like ours,” said Dr. Wells.</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:150px">“Wow!” Wendy seemed genuinely <br />
                        impressed. “You’ve done a great job <br />
                        structuring a root cause analysis by <br />
                        triangulating information from three <br />
                        different sources.”</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:140px">“I have?” asked Dr. Wells, surprised.</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:90px">
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:30pt;"></span>“Gathering information from three different <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:15pt;"></span>sources will help us come to a more accurate <br />
                        conclusion – as long as the sources are reliable.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s the issue Cheryl and I have been arguing about. Cheryl <br />
                        is already convinced she knows the cause of our problem, <br />
                        but I don’t want to rely solely on the opinions of the staff. <br />
                        Especially since the more outgoing employees tended to <br />
                        dominate in the focus groups we conducted. Still, Cheryl has <br />
                        been with me for 12 years, and she’s closer to the staff than I am.”</p>
