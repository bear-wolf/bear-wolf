                    <p>“Which category seems to hold the root cause of the problem?” <br />
                        Wendy asked.</p>
                    <p>“I think it’s the Job Duties/Tasks Category,” Cheryl said.</p>
                    <p>“Why do you think so?” Wendy asked.</p>
                    <p>“Because of the previous research we’ve done – the data from <br />
                        both the focus groups and the survey suggest we need to <br />
                        look at job duties.”</p>
                    <p>“There are four factors in the Job Duties/Tasks category – how <br />
                        can we figure out what’s causing the trouble?” asked Dr. Wells. </p>
                    <p>Wendy proposed a solution. She instructed all 16 employees <br />
                        to provide their individual rating from 1 to 5 for each factor <br />
                        within the Job Duties/Tasks category, with 1 being “Not <br />
                        important to job satisfaction,” and 5 being “Extremely <br />
                        important to job satisfaction.”</p>
                    <p>Wendy quickly calculated the average (mean) of all 16 employees’ <br />
                        ratings, and made a note of this number on the Fishbone Diagram.</p>
                     <div class="BlockImages"></div>
                </td>
                <td class="Last">                                   
                   <p>“This is some pretty interesting stuff, Wendy,” said Dr. Wells. “I’m <br />
                        very impressed. It appears that we’ve discovered some critically <br />
                        important information.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s the magic of triangulation,” said Wendy. “We’ve analyzed <br />
                        the results from the three legs of our triangle: the focus groups, <br />
                        the questionnaire, and the Fishbone Diagram. What overlap do <br />
                        you notice from all three data sets we’ve compiled?”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said Dr. Wells, “We have already established that <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:130pt;"></span>dissatisfaction stems from my <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:150pt;"></span>employees working continuously <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:160pt;"></span>on long, arduous tasks, without <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:160pt;"></span>taking any breaks. This Fishbone <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:165pt;"></span>Diagram definitely supports that <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:170pt;"></span>notion. Look at the ‘Job Duties/<br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:170pt;"></span>Tasks’ section of our Fishbone <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:165pt;"></span>Diagram. The data clearly <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:210pt;"></span>illustrate that, ‘more <br />
