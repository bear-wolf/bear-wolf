                    <p>Dr. Wells’ next consultation with Wendy took place at her office. <br />
                    The doctor had asked Cheryl to join them. Wendy’s workspace, <br />
                    though small, was impeccably organized and neat. Documents <br />
                    and reports claimed their precise places in systematically labeled <br />
                    shelves and file cabinets. The order and efficiency of her office <br />
                    did not surprise the doctor in the slightest. It was clear that <br />
                    Wendy lived by her philosophy of working with economy <br />
                    and attention to detail.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wells had been very tempted to analyze the results of <br />
                    the questionnaire and focus groups on his own, but he had <br />
                    promised Wendy they would do it together, and forwarded <br />
                    her the data files. Wendy felt that analyzing the data as a <br />
                    team would help keep everyone open to all possibilities.</p>
                    <p>“We’re almost there,” said Wendy, as she entered the room. <br />
                    “We’ve gathered information from reliable sources. Now let’s <br />
                    take a look at our results. It’s very nice to meet you, Cheryl. <br />
                    Thanks so much for taking the time to come here today.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you for everything,” said Cheryl. “Dr. Wells has been <br />
                    raving about your critical thinking skills. I’m grateful to be <br />
                    a part of this process,” Cheryl said.</p>
                    <p>“Why, thank you, Cheryl,” Wendy replied.</p>
                    <p>Wendy guided them toward a small conference table <br />
                    where a computer screen displayed a series of charts.</p>
                    <p>“Now, let’s get right down to it, guys!”</p>

                    <p>“When we separate the employees who are <br />
                        involved in the prior authorization process from <br />
                        those who aren’t, there doesn’t seem to be <br />
                        much of a difference in terms of their job <br />
                        satisfaction,” said Cheryl, after they had analyzed the numbers.</p>
                    <p>“You’re right,” Wendy agreed. “We can reject your original <br />
                        hypothesis, Cheryl. But it looks like your employees might need to <br />
                        take more frequent, short breaks throughout the day. We’ll see if <br />
                        we can confirm our new hypothesis at this Friday’s staff meeting.”</p>
