                    <p>“In the meantime,” said Wendy, “let’s review the  <br />
                        information that your friend’s son has gathered.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wells handed Wendy a professionally <br />
                        bound portfolio of photocopied articles <br />
                        and news clips. After paging through it <br />
                        for a few minutes, Wendy turned <br />
                        to Dr. Wells with a smile.</p>
                    <p>“It would be a great learning experience <br />
                        for your friend’s son if you could go through <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:75pt;"></span>this research with him and <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:90pt;"></span>show him which sources <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:94pt;"></span>are reliable, and which <br />
                         <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:98pt;"></span>are not,” she said. </p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:120px">
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:10pt;"></span>Dr. Wells laughed. “At least he isn’t using <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:5pt;"></span>People magazine,” he said, “but I do have <br />
                        my doubts about Wikipedia.”</p>
                    <p style="display:block; margin-left:175px">“I use five criteria for evaluating <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:10pt;"></span>information,” said Wendy “Accuracy, <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:20pt;"></span>Authority, Currency, Objectivity, and <br />

                    <p>That’s where Authority comes in – established and well-respected <br />
                        sources are more credible, as are authors with proven expertise. <br />
                        I always encourage everyone to search for the most Current <br />
                        information available, and, of course, it must be both <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:45pt;"></span>objective and relevant.”</p>
                    <p><span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:45pt;"></span>“When evaluating websites,” continued Wendy, “it <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:45pt;"></span>can sometimes be difficult to discern whether or not <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:35pt;"></span>the information is valid and reliable. One helpful hint is <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:25pt;"></span>to look at how the web address ends. Typically speaking, <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:24pt;"></span>websites that end in .edu or .gov contain information that can <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:23pt;"></span>be considered reliable. Many websites ending in .com contain <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:22pt;"></span>useful and reliable information as well, but be sure take note <br />
                        <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:14pt;"></span>of the author of the website. If there are errors in spelling or <br />
                        grammar, or the page looks unprofessional, that should raise <br />
                        a red flag. The information may not be completely accurate, <br />
                        or may simply be someone’s opinion.”</p>
                    <p>Wendy asked Dr. Wells to <br />
                        get together with Cheryl <br />
                        later to brainstorm some <br />
                        more sources of information <br />
                        about job satisfaction and <br />
                        to determine whether each <br />
                        one met the five criteria: <br />
                        Accuracy, Authority, Currency, <br />
                        Objectivity, and Relevance.</p>
