                <p>For twelve years, Dr. Simon Wells, a well-respected nephrologist, <br />
                    had run a successful practice in Long Island, New York, and had <br />
                    never experienced any dissatisfaction amongst his staff. He was <br />
                    proud that he had never fired any of his employees, and that the <br />
                    majority of his team had been with him for five or more years. But, <br />
                    why would four billing employees quit within two weeks, without <br />
                    any reasonable explanation? Dr. Wells worried that somehow <br />
                    he was to blame for their departure, and the uncertainty of the <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:55pt;"></span> situation made him anxious. Consequently, he and <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:93pt;"></span>Cheryl had spent most of the past week trying <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:139pt;"></span>to uncover the cause of the problem.</p>

                    <p style="display:inline-block; margin-left:170pt;">
                        “Three of our staff members <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:12pt;"></span>in yesterday’s focus group <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:20pt;"></span>discussion complained <br />
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:25pt;"></span>about prior authorizations,”<br /> 
                    <span style="display:inline-block; margin-left:55pt;"></span>said Cheryl.</p>

                <p>“We’ll just have to wait until we get the results of the employee <br />
                    satisfaction questionnaire we distributed,” said Dr. Wells. </p>
                <p>“There’s also that research your friend’s son is doing…” said Cheryl.</p>
                <p>“It will be interesting to see what he digs up,” said Dr. Wells, <br />
                    “although, I’m not sure I should be relying on a college <br />
                    student for advice on how to run my practice.”</p>
                <p> “I wish there was someone whose advice we could trust,” <br />
                    Cheryl sighed.</p>
                <p> At that moment, a recent conversation popped into Dr. Wells’ head. <br />
                    His friend and colleague, Dr. George Osborne, had mentioned a <br />
                    business consultant who had helped him in the past.</p>
                <p> Dr. Wells called George, who gave him the consultant’s number, and <br />
                    within a week, Dr. Wells had set up a meeting with Wendy Berman.</p>
