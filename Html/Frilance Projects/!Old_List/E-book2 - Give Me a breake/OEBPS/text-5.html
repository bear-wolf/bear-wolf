                    <p>Wendy added, “Sometimes... our interpretation of a situation can <br />
                        keep us from seeing what’s really going on. Let me show you <br />
                        something that illustrates this concept.”</p>                    
                    <p>Wendy pulled out her iPad and invited Dr. Wells to watch a video.</p>

                    <p>“I think I know what you mean about missing what’s really going <br />
                        on, Wendy,” said Dr. Wells. “This sort of thing has happened to <br /> 
                        me before. I sometimes get so wound up in everyday minutiae, <br />
                        I don’t see things that are right in front of me.”</p>
                    <p>Wendy smiled. “That’s where critical thinking comes in handy, <br />
                        Dr. Wells. It helps you distinguish among facts, opinions, and <br />
                        assumptions, so you can observe things objectively, and <br />
                        see what’s really happening.”</p>
                    <p>“Now, tell me what your nurse, Cheryl, has to say. I didn’t <br />
                        mean to be rude earlier, or invalidate Cheryl’s thoughts, <br />
                        but first I needed you to give me the objective facts.</p>

                <td class="Last">                
                   <p>Now, let’s hear some opinions on the underlying cause.”</p>
                   <p>“Okay,” said Dr. Wells. “Cheryl believes the low morale in the <br />
                    office, and the recent resignations are due solely to a tedious <br />
                    prior authorization process my billing staff has to follow, to help <br />
                    patients whose insurance companies don’t cover the medications <br />
                    I prescribe. I find it hard to believe an insurance process could <br />
                    cause such dissatisfaction throughout the entire office, but <br />
                    Cheryl insists that the frustration is contagious.”</p>
                   <p>“Cheryl presents an interesting <br />
                    hypothesis about the root cause <br />
                    of the problem. But, I’d like to <br />
                    hear what some of your other <br />
                    staff members have to say.”</p>
                   <p>“I’ll call a meeting for later <br />
                    this week,” said Dr. Wells. <br />
                    “I’d hate to lose any <br />
                    more good people. <br />
                    They’re all so <br />
                    dedicated and <br />
                    hardworking.”</p>
